Tira Sujanpur is also called Sujanpur Tira or Sujanpur Tihra located on the bank of River Beas. It is a beautiful town inhabited by Maharaja Sansar Chand Katoch who was the King of Kangra and later shifted from Kangra to Sujanpur Tira after the war with Muslim kings who wanted to capture Kangra fort. Maharaja Sansar Chand constructed his palaces, temples and courts (called Baradari) on the peak of hillock called Tira overlooking Sujanpur's famous Chaugan, hence the name of the town is Sujanpur Tira. In the middle of this beautiful town there is one square kilometer green ground popularly called in Pahari language 'Chaugan' (which remains green throughout the year). Now part of the ground is occupied by the Sanik School. The ground is a meeting place for most of the town people, ladies, men, children for evening walk and for playing all types of games. Most famous Holi fair also takes place on this ground which lasts almost 2–3 weeks during the month of March.
Based on the caste system each side of 'Chaugan' is occupied by Brahmins, merchants (Vaishyas), Kashtriyas and Shudras. The concept is now waning off. The town has two famous temples constructed by the king which are Bansiwala ( For Lord Krishna) on one side of the ground, and Narvdeshwar on the other side towards the river Beas. 
People of Sujanpur Tira (earlier probably called Sajjanpur due to people being nice, honest and religious-minded) are very hospitable and helpful. Though the town is nowadays thriving with activities and population in around is over 10,000. The people are highly educated and most of them know how to read and write. This town has produced many scientists, administrators, professors, doctors. Once upon a time it was the most educated town in Kangra and Himachal at large. The ruins still remind us the old paintings which exists on the temples and palaces though the passage of time and atmospheric attacks have sullened them a lot. Whatever were left were destroyed by locals by whitewashing due to their innocence.
While Sujanpurtira produced many professionals and writers, a few of them really earned name. Dr. Ishwar Das was the first IAS of 1953 batch who retired as Chief Secretary of Madhaya Pradesh; Dr Sant K. Bhatnagar a Kharagpur IITian achieved eminence in the field of Rubber Technology internationally and authored many scientific papers and religion books; Professor Uttam Chand Mahajan who achievd eminence in Astrology and wrote four books after retiring from active service as Principal, Government College, Hamirpura.Tira Sujanpur is also called Sujanpur Tira or Sujanpur Tihra located on the bank of River Beas.
