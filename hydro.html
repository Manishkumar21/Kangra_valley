 and traverses generally in a north-south direction until Largi, from where it turns sharply at nearly a right angle and flows in a westerly direction up to the Pong Dam. The river traverses a total length of about 116 km (72 mi) from the source to the Pong Dam.
The reservoir drains a catchment area of 12,561 km2 (4,850 sq mi), out of which the permanent snow catchment is 780 km2 (301 sq mi). Monsoon rainfall between July and September is a major source of water supply into the reservoir, apart from snow and glacier melt. The project area experiences hot summers, with maximum temperature of 40 °C (104 °F), with hot and humid climate. Winters are fairly cold and mostly dry.The reservoir stretch is 42 km long (26 mi) with a maximum width of 19 km (11.8 mi), and with a mean depth of 35.7 m (117 ft). While the surface water temperature varies between 22.2–25.1 °C (72–77.2 °F), the incoming river water has a temperature range of 6–26 °C (42.8–78.8 °F).
<h3>Engineering features</h3>
Subsequent to the partition of India, the waters of the Indus river system were allocated river wise, with certain stipulations, as per the Indus Water Treaty (1960), between India and Pakistan. India got exclusive use of the three eastern rivers (the Ravi, the Beas and the Satluj) and Pakistan got the exclusive use of the three western rivers (the Indus, the Jhelum and the Chenab). 
View of flood discharge down the Chute Spillway
The Beas Dam has been built on the Beas River as it enters the plains at Talwara, also called as another temple of modern India. It is an earth core gravel shell dam of 435 ft (132.6 m) height above the deepest foundation, and it is the highest earthfill dam in India. The reservoir or the lake has a storage capacity of 8,570 million cubic metres (303 billion cubic feet). The designed maximum flood discharge of 437,000 cu ft/s (12,295 m3/s) is discharged through a gated chute spillway (pictured) located on the left abutment of the dam.
The confirmed ruling features of the dam are detailed below:<br>
Top of dam - 436 m (1,430 ft)<br>
Normal reservoir level - 427 m (1,401 ft)<br>
Maximum reservoir level - 433 m (1,421 ft)<br>
Dead storage level - 384 m (1,260 ft)<br>
Gross storage capacity: 8,570,000,000 cubic metres (6,950,000 acre·ft)<br>
Live storage capacity: 7,290,000,000 cubic metres (5,910,000 acre·ft)<br>
Reservoir length: 41.8 km (26.0 mi)<br>
Maximum reservoir depth: 97.84 m (321.0 ft)<br>
 The filling and depletion period for the Bhakra reservoir is from 21 May to 20 September and 21 September to 20 May, and for Pong Dam reservoir, from 21 June to 20 and 21 September to 20 June respectively. The two reservoirs supply irrigation and drinking water to Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi andChandigarh. Himachal Pradesh is also provided with drinking water supply.
