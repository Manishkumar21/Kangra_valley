The Brajeshwari Devi Temple is located in the old Kangra Township of the state of Himachal Pradesh, which was built over the charred breasts of Sati. This is the scared shrine which is renowned for its great wealth. Over the ages and decades it has been plundered relentlessly. Mahmud of Ghazni was the first plundered and looted it in 1009. After about 35 years, the local King regained its possession. The scared shrine was repaired and a replica of the idol was enshrined. The Brajeshwari Devi temple was filled with gold, silver and diamonds.
In the year 1360, then later Firoz Shah Tughlaq again ransacked it. After him Emperor Akbar visited the temple with his Dewan, Toder Mal and restored its former grandeur. In the year of 1905 due to an earthquake, the temple was annihilated but a new temple was raised on the same year. It is a white coloured temple which is one of the famous temples in Himachal Pradesh and also one of the 51 Shakti Peeths in India.
