<h3>Pre-Independence</h3>
During the second half of 18th Century, with success of tea estates in Palampur area, the original settlement started developing. In 1888, it was made tehsil headquarter, by shifting the same from Bhawarna. The tea estate owners impressed upon the administration to bring infrastructure like St. Paul's schools, colleges and hospital. It also became a centre of labourers engaged in plucking of tea leaves and packing, transportation and marketing thereof. The earthquake of 1905 left a trail of destruction. Therefore, building style, projections and building material had to be modified. The tehsil complex, school and church towards T-Bud Hotel were built during British Period. Consequent upon laying of railway line for hydro-electric project at Joginder Nagar in 1927 and thereby installation of railway station and staff quarters, construction activity grew fast. Increase in the employment, led to investment in the area, whereby multifarious development including roads took place.
