The large reservoir and its strategic location in the extreme north-west of the northern plains has attracted migratory birds from the plains of India and Central Asian countries and Siberia. More than 220 bird species of 54 families have been recorded.The Pong reservoir and its catchment have the following rich flora and fauna.
<h3>Forest vegetation</h3>
The reservoir peripheral land area has mixed perennial and deciduous pine forests on hills. Eucalyptus trees have also been grown in the area. The forest growth provides enough sustenance to the migratory birds. The tree species of the forest area are Acacia, Jamun, Shisham, Mango, Mulberry, Ficus, Kachanar, Amla and Prunus. A variety of shrubs, grasses and climbers have also been reported.
<h3>Limnology</h3>
A wide variety of commercially viable fish, 27 species of 5 families, such as Mahseer, Catla, Mirror Carp, Singhara (native) and others are recorded in the Pong Dam reservoir and its tributaries.The present fish stocks in the reservoir, in the sequence of their abundance are: 1) Rohu, Aorichthys seenghala, 2) Labeo calbasu (native), 3) Tor putitora (Himalayan Mahseer), 4) Cirrhinus mrigala, 5) Wallago attu, 6) Cyprinus carpio, 7) Labeo dero, 8) Catla catla and 9) Channa sp. The reservoir, unlike other reservoirs in the region, has shown a marked growthin catch of Mahseer fish, recording 20% of the total catch during 1999-2000 with the average size of the fish ranging from 1.5–1.7 kg (3.3–3.7 lb). This is attributed to the change in the Himachal Pradesh (HP) Fishing Rules, with an added clause which specifies the minimum catchable size for Mahseer as 300–500 mm (10–20 in) or approximately 1.2 kg (2.6 lb). That rule is stated to give to each female Mahseer to breed at least once before being caught.
Mahseer angling in the Pong Dam reservoir is said to be the only one of its kind in the country.
<h3>Bird sanctuary</h3>
The reservoir was declared as a bird sanctuary in 1983. The number of birds reported, particularly during the winter period of November to March, has steadily increased over the years. The main bird species reported are the barheaded geese (Goose), Anser indicus, northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea), Northern pintail (Anas acuta), common teal (Anas crecca), Spot-billed Duck (Anas poecilorhyncha), Eurasian Coot Fulica atra, red-necked Grebe (Podiceps griseigena), Black-headed gulls, plovers, Black Stork, terns, water-fowl and egrets.
<h3>Fauna</h3>
The periphery above the water surface area of the reservoir has recorded fauna species such as barking deer, sambar, wild boars, leopards and Oriental Small-clawed Otters.
