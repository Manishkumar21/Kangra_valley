<span class="sub_head2">HISTORY</span>
<span class="cp_text2">
The town gets its name from YOL (Young Officers Leave camp)( Your Own Location- it was so called for the Italian Prisoners), a small town established by British Indian Army around 1849. The Yol Cantt. (cantonment) was built in 1942. Formerly it was known as "majhaitha" village. Yol is the headquarters of the 9 Corps of Indian Army. The cantonment area is very beautiful and has a picturesque view.
Yol was the location of a Prisoner-of-war camp which hosted German soldiers in the First World War and Italian soldiers in the Second World War.
Frogman Elios Toschi, a member of the pre-Armistice Decima Flottiglia MAS and inventor of the "maiale" was one of the very few to escape from the camp. After the war, the former POW facility hosted ethnic Tibetan refugees from China.
